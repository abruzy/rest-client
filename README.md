## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This is really a warmup – you’ll get a chance to poke around HTTP requests from the command line (IRB actually) and also to play around with a new gem called rest-client. This is a useful (and powerful) gem which helps you make HTTP requests. You can use it to do the basic stuff we’re doing here or much more complicated authentication requests.
